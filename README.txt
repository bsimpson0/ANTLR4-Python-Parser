This is my CS 4450 python parsing project
This project uses ANTLR4 and Python3 to parse a simple Python file

Group Members: Blake Simpson (No other group members)

Enviornment Requirements:
    - ANTLR4 installed
    - Python3 installed

In order to run this, you use the following commands:
    - antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 Operators.g4
    - python3 Driver.py testcase3.py

In order to see a parse tree image of the python file, the user can view the .svg image or 
go to http://lab.antlr.org and copy the grammar into the 'Parser' section (make sure the lexer section
is all deleted). Then copy the test file into the 'input' section. This will generate a parse tree image
of the python file.
